# labelmate

## Overview

This document outlines the design of a semi-automated solution for migrating mainframe legacy systems, combining domain expert collaboration with AI. The AI assists in the inspection, assessment, and transformation of legacy code.

## Features

- Enable structured inspection and annotation of mainframe legacy codebase.
- Involve mainframe experts to label meaningful components
- Support scalability, traceability, and validation

## System Architecture

### Labeling Application

- UI for loading and navigating source code.

- Allows tagging components (e.g., business logic, data I/O, control structures, business workflow, etc.)

- Stores labels in a structured format (e.g., JSON, XML)

### Expert-AI Collaboration Layer

- Human-in-the-loop system for labeling guidance and refinement.
- Semi-automated pre-labeling suggestions using static analysis or rule-based methods.

### AI Migration Engine

- Uses labeled datasets to learn code transformation patterns
- Allow many migration strategies such as (autonomous, reengineering, hybrid, strangler pattern, etc.)
- Supports template-based or model-based code generation.

### Validation & Traceability Module
- Run tests and checks on transformed code
- Tracks mappings from source to target code lines for auditability
